## Introduction

**gw-canvas** provides a fast, easy to use text canvas display.  It is designed for Roguelike games.

## General

This library contains everything that you need for the graphics in a simple text based game like a Roguelike.  The Canvas will manage the drawing on the screen.  The drawing is done by putting characters into cells with foreground and background colors.  Sounds simple?  It is with this library.

For visually simple games, this should be all that you need.  However, if you want a game that can vary the display based on levels or colors of light in the scene, or do a fog-like effect for gasses, or mix the colors in other creative ways, then you will probably need the other classes in the library - Color and Mixer.
