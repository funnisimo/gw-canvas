## Glyphs

* Change default glyphs drawn to put the following in the first 32:
  * null (must be index 0)
  * border drawing (11 - for single border only)
  * Arrows (6)
  * box drawing (5 - full, lrtb)
  * triangles (4)
  * That leaves 5 open - pick core ones...

* Colors to CONST
  * add, mix, etc all return new Color
  
* Dancing Colors in Canvas
  * Buffer holds dancing info?
  
* Colors to base 256 (not percents)
  * Percents are option at creation time

* Multipliers are arrays, not colors
  * Based on 100 as 100%
